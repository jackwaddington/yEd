# yEd
One of my favourite software packages &lt;3


I was amazed with relational databases, frustraited with the amount of clicks it took to rebuild diagrams and surprised at the cost of software to create maps from rectangular data.


The software packages that seemed to be able to work with tables of data were Microsoft Visio and Lucidchart, but they were expensive.

https://app.diagrams.net/ was accessable, but could not take in the tables of data.

Behind all the packages, I have a hunch we are dealing with UML https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language

There was a bit of a hump to learn yEd. This repository contains some examples to help buld the relationship between the import conditions and the visualisations.
